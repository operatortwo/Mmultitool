Play Midifile
Assuming: 
	- each Track is using only 1 Midi Channel
	- track Channel is set by Channel Messages on the Track (notify for UI, set at ScreenRefresh)
	- Player uses channel (status-low) directly

--> Editor has to set the right channel when inserting Notes (and other Channel related events)


Alternatively for New Tracklist:
	- Track-Channel is set from user
	- Track-Channel overrides channel set in status-low of Notes and other Channel related events
